âš¡ **Welcome to the Person Counter System Demo on Streamlit Cloud!**  

ðŸ‘‰ The full project is built with **Flask + YOLOv11 + OpenCV** to detect and count people in real-time video streams.  
ðŸ‘‰ Due to limitations of Streamlit Cloud (no real-time video streaming with OpenCV/Flask),  
this deployment is only a **showcase** of the project.  

---

### ðŸ”§ Run Locally (Full Features)
Clone this repo and run locally to experience the full real-time detection:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CodingSuru/person-counter-system.git
cd person-counter-system
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py""")
